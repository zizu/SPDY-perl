SPDY Client

Simple client for testing experimental SPDY protocol. Client can asynchronously process HTTP queries and return results.

Install HOWTO:

Firstly you need OpenSSL lib with NPN extension. Currently there is no stable build with it. So go to [OpenSSL ftp](ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot) and get the latest snapshot with name openssl-SNAP-current_date.tar.gz . 
Use ./Configure and ./config (try to read READMY and INSTALL files if you need non-default parameters). Then use make to compile and make install to install.

Now you need to patch Net::SSLeay for NPN. Download Net::SSLeay from CPAN:
    wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MI/MIKEM/Net-SSLeay-1.42.tar.gz

Extract archive:
    tar -xf Net-SSLeay-1.42.tar.gz

Apply patch
    patch -p0 < nextproto.patch

Configure, compile and install:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Now install SPDY::Client perl module.
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
